                    <h3>Realtor Assist</h3>
                    <p>I created Realtor Assist for my final project of my Bootcamp. I decided to work by myself because
                        I wanted to create an app that would help me at my job as a Real Estate assistant. Realtor Assist
                        is made with Javascript, React, Express, Mongodb, Node.js and Bootstrap. </p>

                    <h3>Primp & Play</h3>
                    <p>For the second project in my bootcamp I worked on Primp and play with a group of three other
                        women. We decided to make a pet grooming and bathing website. I worked on the front end by
                        styling the home page and the new member sign in form. The technologies we used to build Primp &
                        Play are HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Sequelize, MySQL, Node.js and Express. This project
                        taught me how to create and style forms as well as how to work with the back end team to link
                        everything to the database to store the information inputted on the forms. </p>

                    <h3>Giftastic-The Office</h3>
                    <p>Giftastic was a fun bootcamp homework built using Gifs. I am a big fan of The Office so I chose
                        to use gifs of the characters. The GifTastic application searches the GIPHY API to find gifs by
                        pressing search buttons. There is a selection of buttons that are pre-defined, but users can
                        create other buttons through the form on the page. Gifs are displayed with their rating and can
                        be played by pressing them. I built Giftastic with HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and the Giphy
                        API.</p>

                    <h3>Hi! I'm Liana</h3>
                    <p>I started to explore web development as a career after working as an Office Manager.
                        I was always upgrading websites, database and file systems for offices when I decided I wanted
                        to learn how to build these systems myself.</p>
                    <p>I love photography and exploring new places. Being able to tell a story with pictures of places
                        I've been is a great creative outlet.</p>
                    <p>I recently took a career break and explored 6 states in the West and Southwest for 6 months.</p>
